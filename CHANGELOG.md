# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release.

- **The dex is a grid.** Five by four battle pictures instead of 151 rows
  of text. The engine's own comment calls its list *"Minimal Pokédex:
  dex-ordered list with seen/owned markers"*, and it is exactly that.

- **Every owned species in its own colours.** A palette zone binds a
  palette to a tile rectangle, and the engine draws each one scissored
  through the shade-remap shader — so the count is a loop, not a hardware
  limit. The Game Boy could show four palettes at once; this shows
  twenty-one.

  Seen-but-uncaught species are drawn dimmed, on the base palette. One you
  have met but never caught should not be advertising its colours.

- **`SELECT` filters**: ALL, OWNED, MISSING, SEEN ONLY. MISSING is the one
  that earns its place — it is the fastest answer to *what am I still
  short of*.

- **`GRID` `BIG`** asks the renderer for a 320×288 surface, so a 56×56
  battle pic draws at **scale 1**: not halved, not stretched. 56 is also
  seven tiles exactly, which is what makes the colours possible at all —
  `CLASSIC`'s 28-pixel cell is three and a half tiles and can carry no zone.

- **A opens the engine's own species page**, not a copy of it. So
  [Useful Dex](https://github.com/ShaneMcGovernIE/useful_dex) keeps
  working: its base stats, BST, evolutions and movelist pages are one
  press further in. The two mods stack.

- **`REPLACE DEX`** (on) points the START menu's POKéDEX row here; off
  leaves the engine's list untouched and adds a separate `DEX GRID` row.
